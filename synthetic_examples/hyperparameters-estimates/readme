MLE.rda includes estimates for the hyperparameters in squared exponential kernel for 600 synthetic datasets contained in syndata.zip, which are results of performing the Rcode "Oracle MLE for hyperparamters.R".
MAP.zip includes estimates for the hyperparamters in squared exponential kernel for 600 synthetic datasets constained in syndata.zip, which are results of performing the Rcode "weighted MAP for hyperparameters.R".
