syndata_generate.R includes Rcode to generate 600 synthetic datasets, which are saved as syndata.zip.
INLA_synthetic.R is used to perform INLA algorithm on those 600 synthetic datasets.
KS-syn1.r is used to perform kernel smoothing on the first  100 synthetic datasets for the first synthetic example.
KS-syn2.r is used to perform kernel smoothing on the first  100 synthetic datasets for the second synthetic example.
data_1.rda - data_100.rda correponds to intensity function \lambda_1.
data_101.rda - data_200.rda correponds to intensity function 2*\lambda_1.
data_201.rda - data_300.rda correponds to intensity function 3*\lambda_1.
data_301.rda - data_400.rda correponds to intensity function \lambda_2.
data_401.rda - data_500.rda correponds to intensity function 2*\lambda_2.
data_501.rda - data_600.rda correponds to intensity function 3*\lambda_2.

Hyperparameter estimates are saved in MAP folder or MLE.rda.
MLE.rda includes estimates for the hyperparameters in squared exponential kernel for 600 synthetic datasets contained in syndata.zip, which are results of performing the Rcode "Oracle MLE for hyperparamters.R".
MAP.zip includes estimates for the hyperparamters in squared exponential kernel for 600 synthetic datasets constained in syndata.zip, which are results of performing the Rcode "weighted MAP for hyperparameters.R".
