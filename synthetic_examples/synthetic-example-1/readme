Similarly, SGCP_*.py include python codes for the data augmentation via thinning method in Adam et al. (2009).

We apply the above codes to each synthetic dataset included in syndata.zip via .slurm shell files. Check details in the following two .slurm files.
"synthetic_examples/Rcode.slurm"
"synthetic_examples/Pythoncode.slurm"

table_results_*.py include python codes for results presentation in tables of our paper.
