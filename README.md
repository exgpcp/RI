# Exact Bayesian Gaussian Cox Processes Using Random Integral

Include Python and R codes for simulations 3.1 and real examples 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4. Since my python code includes only very common packages I just skip requirement.txt.

###########Simulations: synthetic-example-1

sbatch Rcode.slurm
sbatch Pythoncode.slurm

all "table_results_*.py" could be run seperately to obtain results in table 1 and 2.


##########Real examples:

run each xxx.py seperately
