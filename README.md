# Exact Bayesian Gaussian Cox Processes Using Random Integral
https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19722#

Include Python and R codes for simulations 3.1 and real examples 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4. Since my python code includes only very common packages I just skip requirement.txt.

###########Simulations: synthetic-example-1

sbatch Rcode.slurm

sbatch Pythoncode.slurm

all "table_results_*.py" could be run seperately to obtain results in table 1 and 2 after the above two sbatch codes.


##########Real examples:

run each xxx.py seperately.
